# Enhanced Gutter Information in GigVim Full Configuration

GigVim's full configuration now provides comprehensive gutter information that displays multiple types of contextual data in a clean and organized manner.

## Features Overview

### Git Integration
- **Git diff signs**: Visual indicators for added, modified, and deleted lines
- **Real-time updates**: Changes are reflected immediately as you edit
- **Branch information**: Current git branch displayed in statusline
- **Change statistics**: Addition/modification/deletion counts shown in statusline

### LSP Diagnostics
- **Error indicators**: Red error signs for syntax and semantic errors
- **Warning indicators**: Yellow warning signs for potential issues
- **Info indicators**: Blue info signs for informational messages
- **Hint indicators**: Green hint signs for suggestions and optimizations
- **Severity sorting**: Signs are prioritized by severity level

### Todo Comment Highlighting
- **TODO**: General todo items that need attention
- **FIXME**: Bugs and issues that need fixing
- **NOTE**: Important notes and documentation
- **WARNING**: Warnings about potential problems
- **HACK**: Temporary workarounds that need proper solutions

### Additional Gutter Information
- **Line numbers**: Clean line number display
- **Marks**: Visual indicators for marked lines
- **Folds**: Code folding indicators for collapsible sections
- **Signs**: Custom signs and bookmarks

## Gutter Layout

The gutter is organized into distinct sections for optimal readability:

```
[marks] [signs/diagnostics] │ [line numbers] │ [git diff] [folds]
```

### Left Side (Priority Information)
- **Marks**: User-defined marks and bookmarks
- **Signs**: LSP diagnostic signs (errors, warnings, info, hints)

### Center
- **Line Numbers**: Clear line numbering

### Right Side (Contextual Information)  
- **Git Diff**: Git change indicators (additions, modifications, deletions)
- **Folds**: Code folding indicators

## Visual Indicators

### Git Diff Signs
- `│` - Modified lines (changed content)
- `┃` - Added lines (new content)
- `▌` - Deleted lines (removed content above/below)

### LSP Diagnostic Signs
- `` - Errors (syntax errors, type errors, etc.)
- `` - Warnings (deprecated usage, potential issues)
- `` - Information (helpful information, documentation)
- `` - Hints (optimization suggestions, refactoring hints)

### Todo Comment Icons
- Various colored highlights for TODO, FIXME, NOTE, WARNING, HACK comments

## Configuration Details

### Git Integration (`vim.git`)
```nix
vim.git = {
  enable = true;
  gitsigns = {
    enable = true;
    codeActions.enable = true;
  };
};
```

### LSP Diagnostics (`vim.diagnostics`)
```nix  
vim.diagnostics = {
  enable = true;
  config = {
    signs = {
      text = {
        ERROR = "";
        WARN = "";
        INFO = "";
        HINT = "";
      };
      # ... additional configuration
    };
    severity_sort = true;
    virtual_text = {
      spacing = 4;
      source = "if_many";
      prefix = "●";
    };
  };
};
```

### Status Column (Snacks.nvim)
```lua
statuscolumn = {
  enabled = true,
  left = { "mark", "sign" },
  right = { "git", "fold" },
  folds = {
    open = true,
    git_hl = true,
  },
}
```

## Benefits

### Enhanced Development Experience
- **Immediate Visual Feedback**: See changes, errors, and todos at a glance
- **Better Code Navigation**: Quickly identify problem areas and changes
- **Improved Code Quality**: Visual reminders for todos and potential issues
- **Git Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration with version control

### Clean Visual Design
- **Organized Layout**: Logical separation of different information types
- **Consistent Styling**: Coordinated color scheme and iconography
- **Minimal Clutter**: Essential information without overwhelming the interface
- **Professional Appearance**: Modern development environment aesthetic

## Usage Examples

### Git Workflow
1. Make changes to files - see git diff indicators appear immediately
2. View addition/modification statistics in statusline
3. Use git diff signs to quickly identify changed sections
4. Integrate with lazygit and other git tools seamlessly

### Development Workflow
1. Write code and see LSP diagnostics appear in real-time
2. Address errors (red) and warnings (yellow) as they appear
3. Use todo comments for development planning
4. Navigate using marks and folds for better code organization

### Code Review
1. Visual git diff makes it easy to see what has changed
2. LSP diagnostics help identify potential issues before committing
3. Todo comments serve as reminders for future improvements
4. Clean gutter layout makes review process more efficient
